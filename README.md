# Color Detection

I was inspired to create this project after a former classmate told me that he, due to
his color blindness, would have to FaceTime his sister to help him pick out clothes whose colors didn't clash. This project is designed to be used as
an aid for those with color blindness or any visual impairment that impedes on one's ability to accurately perceive color. <br />
